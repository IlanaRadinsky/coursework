## Day 1
  * [Said Bleik](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/said-bleik/56/551/34b) is guest lecturing on machine learning and [AzureML](https://studio.azureml.net) this week
  * Sign up for a [free trial Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/)
  * Use [last week's digit data](../week3/perceptron) to create logistic regression and perceptron classifiers in AzureML
  * Reproduce your Citibike regression exercise in AzureML using the ``trips_per_day.csv`` data, comparing linear regression with [other available regression methods](http://gallery.azureml.net/Experiment/f35e1ba8a0a34ccd9ce2dc0758de34cb), including non-linear methods
  * Review several examples from the AzureML gallery:
    * [Letter classification](http://gallery.azureml.net/Experiment/bbe8503e4740473a9836aae6a914e3c0)
	* [Demand forecasting](http://gallery.azureml.net/Experiment/d92ab449519a46be9b8f31776c1e638b) for a different bike sharing system
	* [News categorization](http://gallery.azureml.net/Experiment/fcb1bf27ee26443fb19bd07852a620c4)
	* [Clustering for color quantization](http://gallery.azureml.net/Experiment/92bcba7c206649c2ab2152df916dd666)
  * [Publish a web service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/machine-learning-walkthrough-5-publish-web-service/) for one of these experiments
  * Adapt the [sample python code](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/machine-learning-connect-to-azure-machine-learning-web-service/#python_sample) to connect to your web service, pass in data, and get back a prediction
